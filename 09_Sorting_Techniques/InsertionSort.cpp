// This is an in-place comparison-based sorting algorithm. Here, a sub-list is maintained which is always sorted.
// For example, the lower part of an array is maintained to be sorted.
// An element which is to be 'insert'ed in this sorted sub-list, has to find its appropriate place and then it has to be inserted there.
// Hence the name, insertion sort.

// The array is searched sequentially and unsorted items are moved and inserted into the sorted sub-list (in the same array).
// This algorithm is not suitable for large data sets as its average and worst case complexity are of ÎŸ(n2), where n is the number of items.

// no of passes: n-1
// starting from 1 and going till n so n-1
